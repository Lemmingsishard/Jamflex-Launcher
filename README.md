This is project recreates the old RS downloadable client (runescape.exe) from 2003. I have also made a launcher for the clients. Unlike winrune, the clients keep the original functionality by using webview2 run the game its respective website. There are various themes from various eras of the game and they are:

- 2001 (only for 2001scape and RSC Sundae/Perfect)
- 2003 (only for RSC Preservation and 2001scape)
- unthemed (only for RSC Preservation)

I didn't make these themes (except for unthemed and 2001 for 2001scape), so some of them may not look perfect. You can also run a downloadble client from the launcher if you want. Those are all the important details, Happy Scaping.

If you want to commit changes or build this yourself, don't. That is since the source shown is old and an update behind. Please use the latest listed release.
