This is one of the more pointless projects I have made, it existed first to fix a minor inconvience I had with WinRune but then evolved to be a full fledged launcher for bad RSC client wrappers.

If you want to commit changes or build this yourself, don't. That is since the source shown is old and an update behind. Please use the download package that I have uploaded instead
